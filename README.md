## Project Notes

No External Libraries were used with this Project, everything is Contained and Maintained to the Scope of the Project, Reasons for this is the Following: 

1- I didn't want to use any css Libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind because I wanted to Show off my css Skills rather than use my Class Memorization Abilities, that said I am very able to use those libraries.

2- at First I was thinking of using an External Search control, but I had two Problems with that:

  a- I didn't want to Install an Entire Library just for the sake of this one control because most of these Libraries like primeng and material ui imports a bunch of       css files for Theming and Reusable Classes henc point 1, and i Couldn't find a Single Control Library that would fit my needs.
  
  b- I Noticed that I was ahead of time on the Project so I just Created my own, Because why not.
  
I also Decided to use the Control Value Accessor Interface on the Component to make it as Reusable as Possible, this Benefited me because the Routing Implementation Differs between the Search Control in the Home-page and the one in the Header.
   
that said I am also very Capable of using Famous control/ui libraries such as primeng material ui and Kendo UI.

I did the bonus points you mentioned in the assignment file, check them out, one point is that I used a generic Error page I found online, please don't judge me for it ðŸ™ˆ.

One last thing is that I know that the front page needs an infinite scroll implemented, I didn't want to do anything that would change the project too much, although it would improve the performance
   
I had lots of fun working on this assignment and thank you for the consideration.
